## Software Carpentry workshops in Aus/NZ, 2015

This document will be used to guide the final session of the instructor training course, which requires the participants to get together in geographical groups and plan workshops for 2015 (including the construction of draft workshop websites using the template provided [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template)). The document includes not only the names of the instructor trainees for each group, but also of people who have contacted Damien Irving over the last few months expressing an interest in helping out at a workshop (Damien has the contact details for all these people). Participants may also wish to consider planning a [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) workshop, which is a partner of Software Carpentry. 

Group captains are indicated in bold. Everyone should congregate around that person and they will be given collaborator access to this document so they can update it with website links and other necessary information.

#### Brisbane

Due to the large cohort of instructors, there is scope to run a number of workshops in Brisbane in 2015. Belinda Weaver from [QCIF](http://www.qcif.edu.au/) will Skype in for this session, as she is a great supporter of Software Carpentry and can possibly source helpers and funding. 

* Instructors: **Amanda Miotto**, Mitchell Stanton-Cook, Areej Alsheikh-Hussain, Sam Hames, Paula Martinez
* Possible helpers: Michael Imelfort (QCIF), Nick Coghlan (Red Hat), Dan Callaghan (Red Hat)
* Websites:
* Notes: 
   * Keep in mind that the 2015 PyCon Australia conference will be held in Brisbane in early August. In 2014 we held a Software Carpentry workshop immediately before that conference (see website [here](http://philippbayer.github.io/2014-07-30-pyconaus/)) and then some of the participants and helpers stayed on in Brisbane and attended the conference.
   * Belinda is doing the online instructor training course in Feburary
   * Belinda and Mitchell have already been discussing the possibility of hosting a workshop at the UQ Winter School in July 2015

#### Digital Humanities

* Instructors: **Fiona Tweedie**, Angus Ferguson, Daniel McDonald, Kimberly Doyle, Fabian Held

#### Hobart

* Instructors: **Tom Remenyi**, Michael Sumner  
* Possible helpers: Eloise Macdonald-Meyer  
* Website:  

#### Melbourne (Bioinformatics)

[COMBINE](http://combine.org.au/) have already co-hosted two workshops in Melbourne for the bioinformatics community and will be looking to continue this tradition in 2015.
* Instructors: **Scott Ritchie**, Harriet Dashnow, Noel Faux, Andrew Lonsdale, Tim Rice, Thomas Coudrat, Pip Griffin (Peter Hickey?)
* Possible helpers: Simon Gladman, Juan Nunez-Iglesias, Torsten Seemann, Clare Slogett, Kian Ho, others from COMBINE... (Juan and Clare could also be instructors)

#### Weather/climate/ocean sciences
* Instructors: **Rob Johnson**, Nic Hannah  
* Possible helpers: Luke Garde  
* Website/s:

#### Melbourne (Neuroscience)

* Instructors: **Isabell Kiral-Kornek**, Scott Kolbe
* Possible helpers: ResBaz MATLAB teaching team
* Website:
* Notes: Bryan Paton is developing some neuroscience teaching materials (in MATLAB) which might be a perfect fit for a [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) workshop

#### Melbourne (RMIT)

* Instructors: **Ian Thomas**
* Possible helpers: Nicholas May
* Website:

#### Melbourne (Swinburne)

Arna Karick is looking to establish a Swinburne Data Science Institute in 2015 (which will most likely sign on as an offical affiliate of the Software Carpentry Foundation), so she will also attend this session.

* Instructors: **Alistair Walsh**, Ewan Barr, Genevieve Shattow
* Possible helpers: Luz Garcia, Vivek Venkatraman Krishnan, Nicola Pastorello
* Website: [Software Carpentry @ Swinburne](https://github.com/alistairwalsh/2014-11-1-swin)
* Date (preliminary): 22-23rd April 2015 

#### Melbourne (University of Melbourne)

The Research Platforms department (better known through it's [Research Bazaar](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/) program) will be looking to offer a number of workshops for University of Melbourne staff and students in 2015 (although there is also scope to host workshops elsewhere in Melbourne). A particular focus will be running workshops for disciplines at the University of Melbourne that have not had much exposure to Software Carpentry in the past (e.g. economics, botany, mathematics and statistics). Damien Irving will coordinate a discussion in this group about when, where and for whom those workshops will be run.
* Instructors: **Damien Irving**, Andrea Bedini, Jared Winton, Martin Paulo, Nicholas Crouch
* Possible helpers: Luke Zappia
* Website/s:
  * http://resbaz.github.io/2015-05-25-unimelb/ 

#### New South Wales

Due to the large cohort of instructors, there is scope to run a number of workshops in New South Wales (Sydney and Canberra in particular) in 2015. [Intersect](http://www.intersect.org.au/) runs eResearch training at pretty much all the tertiary research institutions in New South Wales, so they are a natural fit to coordinate (and perhaps provide funding for) many of these workshops (Luc Small and Stuart Allen from Intersect are attending the instructor training). 
* Instructors: **Luc Small**, Stuart Allen, Joshua Madin, Fabian Held, Nic Hannah, Jack Simpson
* Possible helpers: Iraklis Konstantopoulos, Mark Cowley
* Website/s:
* Notes: There are already a number of very active instructors in Sydney, including Diego Barneche, Daniel Falster and Rich FitzJohn 

#### New Zealand eScience infrastructure

The [New Zealand eScience Infrastructure](https://www.nesi.org.nz/) sponsored a number of people to come to the instructor training, with a view to coordinating a number of workshops across New Zealand in 2015. They can all get together during this session and plan how this will play out.
* Instructors: **Nick Jones**, John Rugis, Sina Masoud-Ansari, Sung Bae, Mik Black, Cameron McLean, Tom Kelly, James Boocock, Richard Hosking, Constantine Zakkaroff, Prashant Gupta 
* Possible helpers:
* Website/s: 
  * http://sungeunbae.github.io/2015-02-23-canterbury/
  * http://jrugis.github.io/2015-02-26-auckland/
* Notes:
  * Mik, James and Tom are based at the [University of Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz) which intends to become another NZ-based SWcarpentry affiliate and run workshops in co-operation with NeSI.

#### Perth (Curtin University)

* Instructors: **Andrew Rohl**, Raffaella Demichelis
* Possible helpers: Rob Syme
* Website:
* Notes:
   * Philipp Bayer is a very active Software Carpentry instructor who is moving to Perth in early 2015 

   
  
It is hoped that in February 2016 the Research Bazaar conference will be held simultaneously (or near simultaneously) at multiple sites around Australia and New Zealand. The regions with a large representation at the instructor training (e.g. Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart, Auckland) may wish to start considering this option.
